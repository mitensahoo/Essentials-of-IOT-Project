A Mini Project - Smoke Detection System using Arduino and MQ3 sensor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A smoke detection system using Arduino is a project that involves designing and building a smoke detector that is controlled by an Arduino board.
The system is based on detecting smoke particles in the air using a smoke sensor and triggering an alarm when the smoke concentration exceeds a certain threshold.
The system is designed to be low cost and easy to assemble, making it accessible to hobbyists and enthusiasts. 
The main objective of this project is to create a reliable smoke detection system that can be used in homes, offices, and other indoor environments to provide an early warning of potential fires.
Additionally, the system can be expanded with additional sensors or features, such as wireless connectivity, to enhance its functionality. Overall, this project is a great way to learn about electronics and programming while creating a useful device that can potentially save lives.

This project therefore seeks to design a microcontroller based smoke alarm that will continuously monitor the presence of significant amount of smoke and activate an alarm to prompt a safety measure to contain the situation.
This system can be of great in domestic as well as industrial settings to detect smoke and alert people on an impending fire since smoke is a precursor for fire, instead of relying on heat/temperature sensors which sounds alarm when the fire has already started. This can go a long way in helping to save human life. This system can also be used to detect and deter smokers in areas where smoking is prohibited.
The cost of implementing this system is relatively low since the components used are relatively cheap and are easily available in the market. The single microcontroller can be used to interface several sensors with alarms located in different locations as long as more pins are freed for multiple inputs multiple outputs.
